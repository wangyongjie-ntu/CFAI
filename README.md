# About CFAI(Counterfactual Explanation for AI on Pytorch)

Counterfactual explanations mainly target to find the mimimum perturbation which changes the original prediction(Ususlly from an undesirable prediction to ideal one). The perturbation itself is a valid instance following the real data distribution as the training samples. It has broad applications, E.g., finance, education, health care ect. Specifically, what should I do to get the credit card approved if I received the rejection.

This task is popular recently. However, I only find few released repositories on Pytorch platform. Hence, I create this project and plan to implement some famous algorithms continously. 
I appreciate it very much if anyone can contribute to this project together with me.  For the implementation details, I am glad to discuss with all of you together.

A collection of methods on counterfactual explanation to add into this repository. Continously updating.

# Installation

This is a half-year plan. The installation just serves as a placeholder.

**Installation Requirements**
- Pytorch >= 1.0+
- Python >= 3.6

CF only supports Python3+. If you want to install the latest version, run the command in the root folder
```
git clone https://github.com/wangyongjie-ntu/Counterfactual-Explanations-Pytorch

cd Counterfactual-Explanations-Pytorch

pip install -e .
```

For the stable version installation, you can directly install it from PyPI via

```
pip install cf-explanations
```


# Getting Start

To be done.
